# student_t_SV
Student-t stochastic volatility model: R code description

Preliminaries: 

a). Load the R libraries in lines 5-11 of the file CL_algorithm_functions.R and lines 5-9 of the file CLEM_algorithm_functions.R.

b). The R and C++ source function files are -  i). CL_algorithm_functions.R; ii). CLEM_algorithm_functions.R; iii). additional_functions_CLEM_algorithm and iv). cpp_functions.cpp.

Usage:

Run the file Simulation example run.R for an example simulation run. Parameter choices for the NSVt model in Definition (2) of the paper are in lines 11-17 and can be changed as needed.
